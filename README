fixed ape for LaTeX2e and also for use with noweb.

Well, this may do less than ape, but it works w/ LaTeX2e and is not based on
TeX, but LaTeX.

This means you could use anything understanding LaTeX + moreverb (the only
LaTeX package used) to do what you'd like to w/ the LaTeX source..

just for fun!

TO INSTALL: in a machine w/ LaTeX2e, moreverb and flex installed, unpack the
tar file and `make'.

TO USE: [from the Makefile]

	ada2latex <xample.adb >xample.ape               #get ape file from ada src
	latex xample.tex                                #this includes the ape
                                                    #file & uses adalst pkg.
